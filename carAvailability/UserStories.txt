Story: Get non available cars
In order to process a search request
As a carAvailabilty service
I want to get all booked cars and return them

Scenario 1: using car type and date
Given a list of bookings from carBooking service
When I send a GET request to the service with the date and car type I need
Then I should get the list of all cars already booked matching my parameters

Scenario 2: using only car type
Given a list of bookings from carBooking service
When I send a GET request to the service with the car type only
Then I should get the list of all cars with the same type already booked TODO from / to ?

Scenario 3: using only date
Given a list of bookings from carBooking service
When I send a GET request to the service with the date only
Then I should get the list of all cars already booked at this day

Scenario 4: using no params
Given a list of bookings from carBooking service
When I send a GET request to the service without params
Then I should get TODO an error or [ ] ?
